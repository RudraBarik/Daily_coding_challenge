Reverse Linked List
â€‹
Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List (assume that the list has at least 1 node; in other words, the head will never be a null value). The function should reverse the list and return its new head. Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has a "value" property storing its value as well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list or None (null) if it is the tail of the list."""
# Medium
# Time: O(n) where n is the length of the LL | Space: O(1)

# Approach: Remember to use three variables here, first pointer points to null first.
