"""
You are given an integer array and a positive integer K. You have to tell if there exists a pair of integers in the given array such that ar[i]-ar[j]=K and iâ‰ j. 

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N and K - the size of the array and the number K. The second line contains the elements of the array. 

Constraints

1 <= T <= 50 
2 <= N <= 100000 
1 <= K <= 100000 
-100000 <= A[i] <= 100000 

Output Format

For each test case, print "true" if the arrays contains such elements, false otherwise, separated by new line. 

Sample Input 0

1 20 40 100 80 
10 11
12 45 52 65 21 645 234 14 575 112 
Sample Output 0
